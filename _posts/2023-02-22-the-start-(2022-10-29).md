This is the first photo we have ever taken together of just us two and I like to think of it as our "**start**". This was the day of Evelyn's birthday, when I first introduced you to my friends, and I was so relieved to see that you and my friends got along with each other.

I would say that this was our first "date" because it was the first time we actually did a fun activity together *(unless you count Key Club as fun D:)* so this day is especially memorable. We went rollerblading first after a long walk to the pier *(hmm sounds familiar...)* and after landing on our asses several different times, we went out to eat nearby. Finding a table was hella annoying, the price of the food was flabbergasting, and I even spilt something on you *(which was quite embarassing)*, but I still enjoyed every second of it.

Finally, to end off the day, we walked together on the pier and took pictures together. After a butt load of peer pressuring from my friends, we took this amazing photo together, showing Manhattan and the Hudson River in all their glory against the background of the setting sun.

> This day definitely goes down in the books of best days I have ever spent with you, so thank you for being with me.
