This is one of the first subway pictures we have ever taken together, and it makes me happy seeing how far we have come since then. This was taken after our little journey to the **Great Irish Potato Famine Memorial** for you Hanna extra credit, and I remember thinking how cute you were for being shy in taking the selfie. 

> I'm sorry that I do not remember more about this day, but I thought this photo of us together was very cute *(mainly because of you)*, and I hope you agree as well :D.
