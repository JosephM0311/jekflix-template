So much happened on this day that I do not even know where to begin. This was during **New Years**, so rather than spending time with our family making New Years Resolutions, we three overgrown children decided to wreak havoc upon a friendly neighborhood park :D.

If I remember correctly, we met at the Kings Highway train station early in the morning, at which Angelina proceeded in kicking me as usual. We then went to **Greenwood Cemetery** to sightsee, but the view was quite gloomy because of all the dead trees and frozen lakes due to it being wintertime. Climbing up the hills was tiring and avoiding all the shit on the ground was annoying, so we eventually gave up in trying to make the journey worthwhile. Instead, we resorted to plan B: **Japan Village**.

At Japan Village, we shared some udon with each other and went to buy some Japanese snacks at the market. Shopping together was really fun and I do want to shop with you and your sister again in the future so that we can share recommendations to each other or just buy random items. Japan Village is also one of my go-to spots in Brooklyn, so maybe one day we can explore more of the area there rather than just grabbing a bite to eat since I am pretty sure there are lots of activities to do there.

After Japan Village, we went to Sunset Park to do some karaoke on a random rock at the side of the hill. It was hella scuffed, but I had a blast just vibing to Taylor Swift songs with you and your sister. I felt really close to you in the moment just sharing snacks and cuddling with you and I hope we can visit the park again in the future or bring Angelina to an actual karaoke place :D.

> P.S. I really am glad to have a good relationship with your sister (no matter how abusive she may be).
