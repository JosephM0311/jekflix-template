I mean...what can I say? Singing karaoke with you was really fun and I definitely felt less awkward singing on this day than before. It was very nice to vibe in the private room and sing along to songs or just listen to your singing beside you because of how calming it is to be alone with you in our own little private world in the room. 

I will not mention the other **part** of this, but I really enjoy all the time I spend with you. This photo of us together is really cute *(it's one of the rare ones where I have my mask off :O)* and I am glad that I remembered to take a photo of us together this day. Every time I look back on this photo, I start missing you and all the fun we had together so...

> I'm looking forward to our next **100 Fun** session :D.
