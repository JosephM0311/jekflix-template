When I came across this photo while looking back at our album, I was wowed by how good its quality is. I do not remember this subway ride that well, but we looked very comfy together snuggling and cuddling in public :D. The lighting looks very nice, you look amazing as always, and the positioning of our heads is spot on, making this one of my favorite photos of us together.

Also, I **really** do mean it when I say you look really nice without your glasses, which does not mean you are unattractive with glasses on, but as I mentioned before, you look very familiar without your glasses on. I am not sure exactly how to describe it, but I feel extremely comfortable *(and maybe a sense of **nostalgia**)* whenever you have your glasses off, which is kinda strange but hey, maybe we did meet in the past.
